      <item value="&#10;This technique is particularly useful if a module takes a map on input, copies it, and later returns results whose order is determined by that of the copy. (Clients generally appreciate having things returned in the same order they were presented.)" />

      <item value=" without incurring the increased cost associated with TreeMap" />
      <item value="This implementation spares its clients from the unspecified, generally chaotic ordering provided by HashMap (and Hashtable), without incurring the increased cost associated with TreeMap. It can be used to produce a copy of a map that has the same order as the original, regardless of the original map's implementation" />
      <item value="This implementation spares its clients from the unspecified" />
      <item value=" Note that insertion order is not affected if a key is re-inserted into the map. (A key k is reinserted into a map m if m.put(k, v) is invoked when m.containsKey(k) would return true immediately prior to the invocation.)" />

      <item value=" For example, the cache may evict an entry because it hasn't been used recently or very often." />
      <item value="Specifies the maximum number of entries the cache may contain. Note that the cache may evict an entry before this limit is exceeded or temporarily exceed the threshold while evicting." />

      <item value="Memory consistency effects: Actions in a thread prior to submitting a task to a CompletionService happen-before actions taken by that task, which in turn happen-before actions following a successful return from the corresponding take()." />
      <item value="A CompletionService can for example be used to manage asynchronous IO, in which tasks that perform reads are submitted in one part of a program or system, and then acted upon in a different part of the program when the reads complete, possibly in a different order than they were requested.&#10;" />

      <item value="Given the name of a host, returns an array of its IP addresses, based on the configured name service on the system.&#10;The host name can either be a machine name, such as &quot;www.example.com&quot;, or a textual representation of its IP address. If a literal IP address is supplied, only the validity of the address format is checked.&#10;" />
      <item value="An implementation must generate it without blocking, typically in line, and must keep it unchanged. NameResolvers created from the same factory with the same argument must return the same authority." />

      <item value="Implementations don't need to be thread-safe. All methods are guaranteed to be called sequentially. Additionally, all methods that have side-effects, i.e., start(NameResolver.Listener2), shutdown and refresh are called from the same SynchronizationContext as returned by NameResolver.Args.getSynchronizationContext. Do not block within the synchronization context; blocking IO and time-consuming tasks should be offloaded to a separate thread, generally NameResolver.Args.getOffloadExecutor." />
      <item value="A NameResolver does not need to automatically re-resolve on failure. Instead, the NameResolver.Listener is responsible for eventually (after an appropriate backoff period) invoking refresh()." />
      <item value="A NameResolver uses the URI's scheme to determine whether it can resolve it, and uses the components after the scheme for actual resolution." />

      <item value="Conceptually, it is fairly accurate to think of SynchronizationContext like a cheaper Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor() when used for synchronization (not long-running tasks). Both use a queue for tasks that are run in order and neither guarantee that tasks have completed before returning from execute(). However, the behavior does diverge if locks are held when calling the context. So it is encouraged to avoid mixing locks and synchronization context except via executeLater.&#10;" />
